    <p>The void is warmer than you would think.</p> \
    <p>It also hurts, makes you feel like every inch of your flesh is being ripped and torn and burned to ash. It makes your bones feel like they're being shattered into dust. The part of your brain that sends pain signals is constantly overloaded yet kept in pristine condition, so no matter how much it wants to burn and scratch itself to death you keep hurting. The void scrambles you into every possible configuration of atoms and soul while remembering exactly how to put you back the way you were.</p><br> \
    <p>It's a prison.</p><br> \
    <p>Not for people like you and me.</p><br> \
    <p>Not something a human could comprehend.</p><br> \
    <p>This is a prison for gods.</p><br> \
    <p>A torture chamber for beings who can snap their fingers and re-weave reality.</p><br> \
    <p>Pain is not enough.</p><br> \
    <p>They need to be constantly ripped apart and put back together and ripped apart again.</p><br> \
    <p>They need to feel <i>powerless.</i></p><br> \
    <p>To do this, you need a soup made of every single thing that was alive.</p><br> \
    <p>Humans, magical creatures, animals, plants, single-celled organisms.</p><br> \
    <p>Every human, magical creature, animal, plant, bacteria, virus, microbe, that has ever died.</p> \
    <p>At least one god.</p><br> \
    <p>They all torture you.</p><br> \
    <p>They torture you for eternity.</p><br><br> \
    <p>What did I do to end up here?</p><br><br><br> \
    <p>...</p><br><br><br> \
    <p>Once upon a time, there was a human named Airn.</p> \
    <p>She had power, the strongest mage in North America, and a loving partner.</p> \
    <p>She acomplished this at sixteen.</p><br> \
    <p>Then, at the end of the school year, a boy decides to try to impress her.</p> \
    <p>How does he do this?</p><br> \
    <p>He summons the personification of all darkness and death.</p><br> \
    <p>Airn sacrifices her own life to seal it back below the earth.</p><br> \
    <p>Now, I just told you where dead humans go, didn't I?</p><br><br> \
    <p>She wakes up in the void.</p> \
    <p>It asks her what to do with the boy who summoned it.</p> \
    <p>She tells it to rip him apart, not understanding the power she holds.</p><br><br> \
    <p>The boy was found in pieces, arranged on his bed.</p> \
    <p>Each layer of his body had been seperated.</p> \
    <p>His organs were in a pile,</p> \
    <p>his skin laid open.</p> \
    <p>Bones were positioned in the shape of a human.</p> \
    <p>Muscles were placed in tidy rows.</p> \
    <p>The Void returned to its master, eager to be praised for a job well done.</p><br><br> \
    <p>Two years later, a new god rose from below the Earth.</p><br> \
    <p>The Lord of Void.</p><br> \
    <p>It first appeared to a girl named Mina.</p> \
    <p>She had been Airn's partner, and was taking the arch-mage's death hard.</p> \
    <p>The Lord of Void woke her from a depressed slumber.</p><br> \
    <p>It gave her protection from itself.</p> \
    <p>It then asked where Airn's body had been laid to rest.</p> \
    <p>Mina told it.</p><br> \
    <p>The next week, the Lord of Void appeared to Mina again.</p> \
    <p>It wore a different form than it had before.</p> \
    <p>This body was made of Airn's bone, holding the Void in the shape of a human.</p> \
    <p>It spoke to Mina like her lover.</p><br> \
    <p>The Lord of Void was Arch Mage Airn reborn.</p><br><br> \
    <p>Months later, a god named No Body was hatching a plan.</p> \
    <p>He wanted to take the powers of the Gods and become the singular being ruling the cosmos.</p> \
    <p>He recruted a human down on her luck.</p> \
    <p>That human was me.</p><br> \
    <p>No Body captured the Lord of Void's friends.</p> \
    <p>He lured her into a trap, using his power to destroy her body.</p> \
    <p>Before the Lord of Void came back, I... I assaulted one of her friends.</p> \
    <p>When she arrived, her friends told her what I had done, and...</p> \
    <p>I pleaded with her to no avail.</p> \
    <p>I begged No Body to help.</p> \
    <p>He disowned me and left me to Void's mercy.</p> \
    <p>She sent me here.</p><br> \
    <p>There are so many other punishments she could have used.</p> \
    <p>She could have killed me, maimed me, traumatized me.</p> \
    <p>Instead, she sentenced me to eternal torment.</p> \
    <p>Here I will stay until my mind breaks so completely even the Void can't put me together again.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br> \
    <p>How I yearn for that day.</p> \

    <h1 id='char' class='void'>???</h1> \
    <div class='background'> \
    <p>Cool, blissful air swirls around me.</p> \
    <p>Every milimeter of my body aches, and I don't remember how to stand, so I don't try. I collapse on the ground. Fresh pain shoots through the parts of me that strike first; it takes me a few seconds to pinpoint what's hurting. I'm lying facedown, long green things tickling my face. Grass. I haven't seen grass in... a long time.</p> \
    <p>How much time has passed since I was sealed?</p> \
    <p>An important question, but I have other things to figure out. For example, why my lungs are burning.</p> \
    <p>I need to breathe. The void doesn't have air, so I didn't have to worry about breathing. It kept me alive to feel more pain.</p> \
    <p>I gasp for air like I'm drowning, trying to remember how my diaphragm works.</p> \
    <p>\"Want some help?\" I don't look at whoever's speaking, I just roll my head into the ground. A second later, my lungs fill with a warm almost-liquid substance that weighs nothing and makes my flesh feel like static. It expands, forcing me to suck air into my lungs, and contracts, pushing CO<sub>2</sub> out. The cycle continues without my input.</p> \
    <p>I raise my head to look at the person breathing for me. Bleached-bone horned mask, undulating black neck disappearing into a white button-up shirt, shiny black pants and shoes. Cuffs rolled up to her elbows, revealing the shifting darkness between the plates of bone that give her body shape. Of course it's Airn. Who else would it be? I return my skull to the oddly soft grass.</p> \
    <p>\"We both want to get this done quickly, right?\" I grunt into the dirt. Airn is the last person I want to talk to. \"All the bones in one of your arms for a hundred years off your sentence.\"</p> \
    <p>I have to raise my head to give her a look that speaks all the questions in my head. Why does she want my bones? What's she going to do with them? Since when did my sentence have an end date? What is it?</p> \
    <p>\"Yes or no.\" I <i>do</i> have a choice? It's not if it gets my sentence over faster.</p> \
    <p>\"Why-?\" I croak. My voice sounds like it was torn to shreds, ground against sandpaper and glass and then cobbled back together, which is pretty much what happened.</p> \
    <p>\"None of your business.\" Her eyes drill into me, coldly confident as always.</p> \
    <p>\"Fine,\" I sneer. Airn walks over to me- she was farther away than I thought- and lays a hand on my arm. Pain screams raw and scorching through its core before being washed out by cool darkness. I might have screamed; it hurt too much to be sure.</p> \
    <p>I sit up and glare at Airn, cradling my arm. It doesn't hurt anymore, but it's half numb and isn't responding to my brain's commands it to move. I'm starting to panic just a little bit.</p> \
    <p>\"I didn't say anything about the pain.\" The bitch of the void is kneeling next to me, holding a bunch of long pink-white sticks. My head spins when I look at them. Are those my bones? They look too red, too small, too thin. That's what was shaping my arm? My stomach is threatening to empty whatever's left in it. I have to look away.</p> \
    <p>\"One century's shorter stay in the Abyss.\" She looks at me like a bug she's experimenting upon.</p> \
    <p>\"Now I go back?\" My voice comes out in a not-entirely-intended snarl.</p> \
    <p>Airn snaps her fingers in response.</p> \
    <p>I return to Hell.</p> \

    <p>Airn repeats her little cycle, bringing me out of her Abyss every once in a while to trade bones for pieces of my sentence. My left arm (one century), both legs (a century each), my torso (apparently worth a hundred and fifty years) and my skull (one final century). I've asked why every time. I don't have an answer.</p> \
